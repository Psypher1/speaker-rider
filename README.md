# Speaker Rider

> Last modified August 15th, 2023.

Hi, thanks for looking at my speaker rider! ðŸ’–

This is a set of requirements and standards for accepting an offered speaking slot.
The points here are all things I believe conferences should be doing anyway to make for a more accessible, equitable event for everybody involved.

## tl;dr

- **Accessibility**: Be it, whether in-person and/or online
- **Accommodations**: Pay for travel expenses and my ticket

## Accessibility

### In-Person

If the event is in-person, all areas -including any auxiliary events like official afterparties or co-located events- must be accessible to those who require mobility aids, including stages.
They should adhere to at least the hosting country's equivalent of [ADA standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990).

### Virtual

All online services necessary for the event, including its website and any video platforms, should be usable by users who with limited or no eyesight, hearing, and/or mobility.
Any website created by the event should conform to [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref) by the date of the conference at Level A and at least mostly at AA.

Captioning should be provided, ideally live by a trained professional.
If there is absolutely no other option, auto-generated captioning is not the greatest but will suffice.

## Accommodations

No part of the cost of speaking at your event should lie with the speaker.
You should cover at least:

- My ticket to the event
- Lodgings in an Airbnb or hotel near the venue the nights before and after the event
- Travel to and from the event, such as flights or trains\*

\*If you are a regional and/or smaller conference with a limited budget and relatively cheap attendee tickets (<=$200/day), we can discuss omitting this requirement.

### COVID Safety

Any event venue should comply with local, state, and federal COVID restrictions, including any mask and vaccine requirements.

### Speaking Fees and Honorariums

Since speaking at events helps me promote myself and my projects, I do not generally require a speaking fee or an honorarium.
This is especially true for non-profits, community events, or events where the cost of attending is heavily reduced.

For large-scale corporate events where the organizing company stands to make a profit or private internal corporate events, my fee is negotiable based on the size of the event and whether I am a keynote speaker.
If I am being paid, all other speakers should be paid as well.


## This Rider

Thanks for reading all of this speaker rider!
I hope none of it is particularly surprising, and that it's reasonable for you.
