# Speaker Rider

> Last modified August 15th, 2023.


## Intro
Hi there! First, I'm delighted that you're interested in having me speak at your event. I truly love what I do, and I'm always excited for another opportunity to share my knowledge and viewpoints with others. That said, I do have some requirements and standards for accepting an offered speaking slot, submitting to an open CFP, or engaging in any kind of promotion for an event (yes, including retweets).

## TL;DR

- **Accessibility**: Be it, whether in-person and/or online
- **Accommodations**: Pay for travel expenses and my ticket
- **Code of Conduct**: Have a real one

## Accessibility

### In-Person

If the event is in-person, all areas -including any auxiliary events like official afterparties or co-located events- must be accessible to those who require mobility aids, including stages.
They should adhere to at least the hosting country's equivalent of [ADA standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990).

### Virtual

All online services necessary for the event, including its website and any video platforms, should be usable by users who with limited or no eyesight, hearing, and/or mobility.
Any website created by the event should conform to [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref) by the date of the conference at Level A and at least mostly at AA.

Captioning should be provided, ideally live by a trained professional.
If there is absolutely no other option, auto-generated captioning is not the greatest but will suffice.

## Accommodations

No part of the cost of speaking at your event should lie with the speaker.
You should cover at least:

- My ticket to the event
- Lodgings in an Airbnb or hotel near the venue the nights before and after the event
- Travel to and from the event, such as flights or trains\*

\*If you are a regional and/or smaller conference with a limited budget and relatively cheap attendee tickets (<=$200/day), we can discuss omitting this requirement.


### Speaking Fees and Honorariums

Since speaking at events like yours is a large part of my job, I do not generally require a speaking fee or an honorarium. This is especially true for non-profits, community events, or events where the cost of attending is heavily reduced.

For large-scale, corporate event where the organizing company stands to make a profit, or private internal corporate events: in both of these cases, my fee is negotiable based on the size of the event and whether or not I am a keynote speaker. If I am being paid, all other speakers should be paid as well.


## Code of Conduct
Your event must have an explicitly-defined, enforced Code of Conduct linked publicly on your event's website, preferably as a top-level menu item. It should include a clear, readable description of what behavior is and is not acceptable, as well as at least one way for someone to report a violation. A paragraph of legalese buried in the Terms of Use is not sufficient to meet this requirement. If you're looking for inspiration, the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) is a great place to start.
